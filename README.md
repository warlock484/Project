Projects info:


The 1st project named Animals emulates the game of Animals by asking the user a series of question to try and guess the animal.If he manages to find out the name the animal the game will end but if he doesnt he will ask you the name and register the name into his memory getting ready for the 2nd round.

The Binary Decoder is the 2nd project and after the user gives it a binary string it will  decode it into a decimal value and display it on  a 16x2 LCD DISPLAY.It uses an ESP32 to do the decoding and a potentiometer to adjust the brightness of the LCD.

The 3rd project checks if 3 user inputed numbers can verify pythagora's theorem and then searches another 2 numbers for each number to form another right triangle.It also checks if the given number is part of a  multiple of a pythagorean triple.
